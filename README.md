# UFITEST
## What the heck is this?
Tiny project just for myself to understand distinctions between Unit, Functional, Intergration tESTs properly
## What is expected?
I want to try here all the types of testing by creating the very simple project with almost no actual purpose.
Also all this fancy autotest CI docker stuff is highly welcomed.
